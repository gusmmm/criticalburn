- it is a set of international standards for exchanging electronic health information between different healthcare systems.
	-  It provides a framework that defines how information is packaged and communicated, ensuring that systems can share data like patient demographics, medical history, lab results, and more. 
	- HL7 enables interoperability, allowing various healthcare applications and systems, such as EHRs, lab systems, and pharmacies, to communicate and exchange data effectively. 
- What is HL7 for?
	- [[Interoperability\|Interoperability]]
		- HL7's primary function is to facilitate communication between different healthcare systems. 
	- [[Data Exchange\|Data Exchange]]
		- Hl7 defines how data should be structured and formatted, allowing systems to share information like patient demographics, medical history, lab results, medication information, and more. 
	- [[Clinical Messaging\|Clinical Messaging]]
		- HL7 provides a messaging standard for transmitting clinical information, such as laboratory test results, radiology reports, and other diagnostic findings. 
	- [[Integration with EHRs\|Integration with EHRs]]
		- HL7 plays a crucial role in integrating various healthcare applications with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, ensuring data flows seamlessly between them. 
	- [[Automated Workflows\|Automated Workflows]]
		- HL7 can help automate standard workflows, reducing manual effort and potential errors, which can lead to cost savings and increased efficiency. 
	- [[Support for New Technologies\|Support for New Technologies]]
		- HL7 is constantly evolving to support new technologies and healthcare needs, including the development of newer standards like FHIR. 
# HL7 FHIR
- [[Namespaces/Standards/HL7 FHIR\|HL7 FHIR]] (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a healthcare data standard developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7). 
- It enables the exchange of healthcare information electronically between different systems, using modern web technologies like [[RESTful API\|RESTful API]]s and JSON or XML. 
- FHIR is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to implement, making it suitable for a wide range of healthcare applications
